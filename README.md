# Vote_Unchained

# Blockchain-based Voting System

## Overview
This project is a decentralized, secure, and transparent voting system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages smart contracts written in Solidity, managed by the Truffle framework, and deployed locally using Ganache. The frontend is built with React, providing a user-friendly interface for voters. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is integrated for decentralized data storage and retrieval.

## Features
- **Decentralized Voting**: Votes are recorded on the blockchain to ensure immutability and transparency.
- **Smart Contract Security**: Solidity smart contracts manage the voting logic and ensure tamper-proof election processes.
- **IPFS Storage**: Proposal metadata and related documents are stored on IPFS for decentralized and secure access.
- **User Interface**: A responsive React frontend allows voters to interact with the voting system seamlessly.
- **Local Blockchain**: Ganache is used as a local Ethereum blockchain for testing purposes.

## Tech Stack
- **Solidity**: Smart contract development
- **Truffle**: Ethereum development framework
- **Ganache**: Local blockchain for development and testing
- **IPFS**: Decentralized file storage
- **React**: Frontend framework
- **Web3.js / Ethers.js**: Blockchain interaction
